# ðŸŽ¨ Portfolio v2

A sleek and modern developer portfolio I built to showcase my skills, projects, and personality. Inspired by clean design, performance, and accessibility â€” this site isn't just a rÃ©sumÃ©, it's an experience. I wanted every interaction to feel fast, smooth, and polished.

## ðŸ’­ Why I Built This

I wanted more than just a digital CV â€” I needed a place to show what I can really do as a frontend developer. This portfolio reflects not only my technical skills but also my taste in UI/UX, design precision, and code quality. Every section is crafted with intention:

- Subtle animations to guide the eye.
- Projects that speak for themselves.
- A layout that respects both form and function.
